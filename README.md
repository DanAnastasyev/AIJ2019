The winning solution for the [AI Journey 2019 contest](https://contest.ai-journey.ru/) based on the [official baseline](https://github.com/sberbank-ai/ai-journey-2019/tree/master/examples/sberbank-baseline).

The solution structure is similar to the baseline's one: the most interesting code can be found in the `solvers` folder.

Beware: some of the baseline solvers were not removed (due to our laziness and lack of the time) and their improved versions can be found in separate files (e.g., `solver17.py` should have been replaced by `punctuator.py`). Check `solution.py` to find out what solvers were actually applied.
